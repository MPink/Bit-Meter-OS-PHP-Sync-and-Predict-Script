This is a php script that downloads multiple Bit Meter export files and combines them.
It then displays total usage for each day and a graphic representation of who used what.

It requires bit meter to be running on all computers with remote access enabled.

And then a php server to run the script.
may i sugest http://www.wampserver.com/en/ if you dont have one.

Things still to do

1) work out why there are disparity between export files.
A lot of times lines are missing for the end of export files.
In some very unusual cases blocks of data has been missing form the middle of the files.
Is this my fault or Bit Meters ?

2) Build it into the Bit Meter Client so you dont need a brain and a php server to run it
